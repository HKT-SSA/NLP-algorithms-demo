    "Text Classification can be used to solve various use-cases like sentiment analysis, spam detection, hashtag prediction etc. This notebook demonstrates the use of SageMaker BlazingText to perform supervised binary/multi class with single or multi label text classification. BlazingText can train the model on more than a billion words in a couple of minutes using a multi-core CPU or a GPU, while achieving performance on par with the state-of-the-art deep learning text classification algorithms. BlazingText extends the fastText text classifier to leverage GPU acceleration using custom CUDA kernels."
